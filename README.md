# Quests

A PMMP Quest plugin - I no longer use it but it was coded for my server

I have used it for a few seasons on my server, is good for starter gear or just simple quests

Every reward is given by command (in the config.yml)

I will do up a better config and read me, I did this in a rush as I am working on a prisons server.

Commands:

- /quest

Permissions:

- None (Default)

Feel free to check out my server:

- IP: play.scepternetwork.com
- Port: 19132 (Default)
