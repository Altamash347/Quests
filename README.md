A Quest Plugin - this was coded for my server and is no longer used on it. I might use it again in the future, but as of now I no longer use it so I decided to release it :D

I have used it for a few seasons on my server, is good for starter gear or just simple quests

I will do up a better config.yml and README (If not yet done), I did this README in a rush as I am working on a Prisons Server.

----------

Features:

- Detailed config.yml
- Built in UI (FormAPI)
- Custom Quests
- Multiple Quests (unlimited)
- Multiple Categories(unlimited
- Custom Rewards (using commands)
- Messages can be configured in the config.yml

Quest Types:

- Break (breaking a block)
- Move (move a block)
- Place (place a block)
- Kill (kill other players - pvp)

Commands:

- /quest

Permissions:

- None (Default)

----------

Plugin Depends:

- None
- NOTE: This plugin has built in forms using FormAPI however it DOES NOT depend on any other plugin.

Errors:

- No error message if /quest is rank in console

Bugs:

- NONE

----------

Updates:

- Do I plan on doing any? Probably NOT. If you wish to do some updates and pull request it I will happily approve it.

This is kind of a good plugin for a Factions Server. However I used it for Skyblock.

----------

Feel free to check out my server:
